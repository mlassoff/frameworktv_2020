Since the creation of the world wide web, things have stabilized a bit.  There are currently five or six languages that are used to create the apps and websites you use each day.  \n\nThe most popular of these is JavaScript. JavaScript is a two-decade-old language used to program interaction within web applications. In recent years, JavaScript has expanded to be used on web servers and mobile applications as well. Because it can be used almost everywhere JavaScript is an important language to know right now.\n\nAlso currently popular are the languages PHP, Java, and C-sharp. These languages are used on web servers to create enterprise-level software and applications like eCommerce systems, content management systems and the business end of multiplayer online games.\n\nFor Framework Technical Minute, Iâ€™m Mark Lassoff",

Worldwide, it appears, that battle may be over and a winner has been declared.\n\nAccording to CNET, a full 85% of mobile devices globally run the Android operating system.  iOS has a 13% market share worldwide.\nThe numbers in the US tell a bit of a different story.  According to Statista, iOS holds 48% of the US market share while Android is used on 51% of phones.  Appleâ€™s iOS operating system has been growing in the US over the last five years taking market share away from Android, and benefitting from the death of the Microsoft mobile and Blackberry Operating Systems.\n\nWorldwide Androidâ€™s lead may be insurmountable, but, the battle for mobile dominance in the United States continues with the new iPhone 11 and Google Pixel 4 making compelling arguments for both sides.\n\nFor Framework Technical Minute, Iâ€™m Mark Lassoff\n\nWeb:  http://www.frameworktv.com\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/frameworkcommunity/\n\n\n #android #iOS #BestSmartphone #BestPhone #BestTech",

Minecraft, the popular terrain building games, offers coding programs supported by Microsoft that teach coding skills in-game.\n\nThere are also a number of toy robot that helps kids learn coding skills, like the Wonder Workshop Dash and Legoâ€™s Boost Creative Tool Box Fun Robot.\n\nFor older kids, thereâ€™s everything from after-school training centers to summer camps that teach coding skills.  Code Ninjas, for example,  is teaching kids development skills from coast to coast, while the iD Tech Summer Camps will have kids coding at over 100 college campuses across the country.\n\nFor Framework Technical Minute, Iâ€™m Mark Lassoff\n\n\nWeb Site: http://www.frameworktv.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/frameworkcommunity",

That amount of traffic translates to nearly 1.9 billion internet video users and three trillion minutes of video consumed each month.\n\nYouTube alone boasts 1.3 billion users and an audience that includes 8 out of ten 18 to 49-year-olds.\n\nSuffice to say internet video is exploding.\n\nIncluded in the category of internet video are short-form videos, like those found on YouTube as well as streaming video found on Netflix or Roku.  Whatâ€™s missing from the video stats?  Gaming.  Games are another exploding category closely related to video.\n\nWhatâ€™s the next trend in online video?  Convergence.  As Youtube gets into streaming television and movies with its Youtube TV option expect to see more video sites trying to offer all forms of video under a single brand.\n\n\nFor Framework Technical Minute, Iâ€™m Mark Lassoff\n\nWeb:  http://www.frameworktv.com\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/frameworkcommunity/",

Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are two different technologies used to represent the real world with digital augmentation, and a completely virtual world.  In this video, Mark will explain the difference between augmented reality and virtual reality.\n\nTranscript\nFrom futurists to tech junkieâ€” everyone seems to be talking about AR and VR technology. Known formally as Augmented reality and Virtual reality, AR and VR could have a huge impact on everything from education and training to video games to how wars are fought.  \n\nAugmented reality adds digital elements to a live view of the real world.  We see Augmented frequently used in conjunction with mapping technology. Google famously uses AR technology to translate signs in maps from language to language.  Pokemon Go was another application of Augmented Reality.\n\nVirtual Reality is a completely immersive experience that shuts out the real world.  It allows the user to be transported to a completely different world and requires the use of VR mask.  The growth of both AR and VR has been exponential and the applications will only get more realistic as processing speed and available bandwidth continue to grow.\n\n\nFor Framework Technical Report, Iâ€™m Mark Lassoff\n\n\nWeb Site: http://www.frameworktv.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FrameworkTelevision",

In this video, Mark will create four versions of the application so you can see how core functionality is coded and additional features are added in new iterations. You'll see exactly how to build an app from start to finish as JavaScript and jQuery are used to create the project. The app itself is a random password generator, which allows you to create a password of any reasonable length and choose the types of characters that are included in the application. As the process of building an app continues, features are added to make the password generator more useful.",
